## About

Yuwei is a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of [East Asian Languages and Civilizations](https://ealc.uchicago.edu/) and a [Neubauer Family Distinguished Doctoral Fellow](https://grad.uchicago.edu/fellowships/neubauer-fellows) at the University of Chicago. She also serves as a research assistant at the [Centers for Middle Eastern Landscapes (CAMEL)](https://camelab.uchicago.edu/) in the Institute for the Study of Ancient Cultures. 

Specializing in Bronze Age Chinese archaeology and paleography, she concentrates specifically on the Central Plain (_zhongyuan_) area during the Shang and Zhou periods. Her research broadly interests in landscape archaeology, human-environmental interaction, place-making, and monumentality. Her dissertation, entitled "Life and Death in a Shang City: Mortuary and Urban Landscapes of Late Shang (1250-1046 BC) Anyang, China" combines theoretical discussions in ancient urbanism and mortuary landscape to investigate the formation of neighborhood identity and cultural memory at the ancient city of Anyang. Methodologically, she incorporates computational methods like GIS, space syntax, network analysis, statistical analysis, deep learning, and machine learning with archaeological, paleographical, and historical sources.

Yuwei has been involved with multiple digital humanities and computational archaeology projects. Currently, she is working on the [AI-Assisted Archaeological Remains Detection (A3RD)](https://camelab.uchicago.edu/project/a3rd/) project at CAMEL that uses deep learning for archaeological feature detection. She served as a geospatial analyst and web developer for the [Sichuan Religions](https://sichuanreligions.com/) project and a research analyst for the [Afghan Heritage Mapping Project (AHMP)](https://isac.uchicago.edu/research/projects/preservation-cultural-heritage-afghanistan) project.

Yuwei holds an M.A. in EALC from the University of Chicago (2023), and a B.A. in History and a B.S. in Mathematics-Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego (2020).
